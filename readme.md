# Neural closure models

## About this repo

This repository contains the code associated with my master thesis.
It includes code for:

- Generating training data by solving PDEs/ODEs:
    - Burgers' equation
    - The Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation
    - The Lorenz '96 model
- Training a variety of ML models on the resulting data
    - TODO

## Installation

1. Install [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/). This software was run with Julia version 1.7.3, although other 1.7.x versions should also work.
2. Install dependencies by launching `julia` in this folder:

    ```shell
    > cd neural-closure-models
    > julia --project=.
    ```

    and installing all dependencies by running:

    ```julia
    using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()
    ```

## Generating training data

Once Julia is installed and running, the training data can be generated by the following sets of commands:

```julia
include("src/datageneration/common.jl")

# Burgers
include("src/equations/burgers.jl")
include("src/datageneration/burgersdata.jl")
createfullburgersdata()
createreducedburgersdata()

# Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
include("src/equations/kuramotosivashinsky.jl")
include("src/datageneration/ksdata.jl")
createfullksdata()
createreducedksdata()

# Lorenz '96
include("src/equations/lorenz96.jl")
include("src/datageneration/lorenz96data.jl")
createfulllorenz96data()
createreducedlorenz96data()
```

Note that this will take a while, and the resulting training data for all data sets is ~5GB.
